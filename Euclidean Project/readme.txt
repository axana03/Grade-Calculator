I used python version 3.6.3 and the MAC platform. In this project, I am finding the pairwise Euclidean distance between any
data a) using loop and b) without any loop but with the matrix operations by numpy. 
The graph as shown in report of comaprison of correlation computation method shows that the loop function is ineeficient 
as it takes a very long running time compared to numpy function.
